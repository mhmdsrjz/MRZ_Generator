<h2>What is MRZ</h2><br>
The MRZ or Machine Readable Zone is the part of an identity document, driver’s license, passport, etc., containing the identity data of a person in a language that a machine can understand. It is 2 or 3 lines of coded information, a series of characters, numbers and separators whose initial objective was to speed up the automatic reading of a person’s personal data. The MRZ provides personal data in a standard format to be automatically identified and extracted by a machine.<br><br>
